LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture renowned for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs feature specialized memory cells with gates that regulate the flow of information, enabling the network to selectively retain, update, or discard information over time. These gates include the input gate, which controls the flow of new information into the memory cell; the forget gate, responsible for determining which information to discard from the memory; and the output gate, which regulates the flow of information from the memory cell to the network's output. By effectively managing information flow, LSTMs excel in tasks involving sequential data, such as time series prediction, natural language processing, and speech recognition, making them a fundamental architecture in various machine learning applications.
